After the first launch, the `ComfyUI/models/xlabs/loras` and `ComfyUI/models/xlabs/controlnets` folders will be created automatically. <br/>
So, to use lora or controlnet just put models in these folders. <br/>
After that, you may need to click "Refresh" in the user-friendly interface to use the models. <br/>
For controlnet you need install https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux <br/>
